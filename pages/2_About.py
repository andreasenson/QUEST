#Routing Algorithm
st.subheader("Flood Evacuation Routing Algorithm")

st.write("""
        Under the hood: we load flood polygons (EPSG:32651), create a smart grid over the affected area, assign per-node risk with batched spatial joins, then build a graph connecting neighboring grid points. Each edge gets a distance and a risk-weighted cost. For routing we run A* with a Euclidean heuristic. A single slider controls the risk penalty factor: 1.0 = fastest, >1 = progressively safer routes. This is soft avoidance â€” we penalize risky edges instead of forbidding them, which keeps routes feasible while prioritizing safety.
